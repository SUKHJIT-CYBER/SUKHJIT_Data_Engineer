# SUKHJIT_Data_Engineer
###Assignment Submission for the Profile of Data Engineer at SteelEye
##This repo consists of my assignment solution for the role of Data Engineer (i.e) Python Engineer .
Language used = Python 
version = 3.9.7

#File_Structure
###main_fun.py = This file consists of all the implemented functions
###env_variables.py = This file consists of all the enviornment variables
###unit_tests.py = This file consists of unittests implemented
###logger.py = This file consists of custom logger
###run.py = Its not related as i was adding some other functionality , but did not work well
###logs/controller.log = This consists of all the logs developed during running of file "main_fun.py" and "unit_tests.py"


To Run this ,
1. First, Import all the python libraries and if need to install you can run in terminal 
     pip install {libarary-name} 

2. Update the variables in "env_variables.py"  and add your  aws_id and other etc.
3. For, the main implementation run the "main_fun.py" file using the command in terminal

           python main_fun.py

4. You will get the results as mentioned in the assignment.<zip , xml , csv file will be added >

5.  Similarly, you can implement the "unittests" by using the following command
         
          python unit_tests.py


You, can check the "controller.log" file in <log> directory to check your logs and errors and sucess test cases

In AWS S3 Bucket and Lambda Implementation, I had implemented the code .But I was not able to implement it on AWS console as due to unavialability of billing details confirmation on AWS platform .I am sure that I have implemented my function to upload to S3 bucket and will work by updating credentials in "env_variables.py"

THANK YOU.
